This provides an overview of how to make changes to the documentation for the Computational Thinking App. Following these guidelines will help ensure that the documentation remains clear, consistent, and easy to navigate.

### Before You Begin

1. Familiarize yourself with the existing documentation and structure.
2. Set up a local copy of the documentation repository on your machine (follow steps in [Getting Started](../Setup/getting-started)).

### Running and Building the Documentation Locally

To run and build the documentation locally, you can use the following scripts:

- `npm run start`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the documentation for production.
- `npm run serve`: Serve the production build locally.

These commands are executed using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator built with [React](https://react.dev/).

### Making Changes

When making changes to the documentation, please keep the following in mind:

1. Use clear and concise language.
2. Maintain a consistent tone and style throughout the documentation.
3. Organize content using headings and subheadings.
4. Use code blocks to provide examples and illustrate concepts.
5. Check your changes locally to ensure proper formatting and display.

### Submitting Changes

Once you have made your changes, follow these steps to submit them:

1. Commit your changes to your local branch.
2. Push your changes to the remote repository.
3. Create a pull request to merge your changes into the main branch.
4. Wait for a project maintainer to review and approve your changes.

By following these guidelines, you will help ensure that the documentation for the Computational Thinking App remains a valuable resource for developers, contributors, and maintainers. Thank you for your contributions!
