- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)

To get started, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Clone the repository locally:** Clone the main repository to your local development environment.

2. **Create a new branch:** Create a new branch for each feature or bugfix you want to work on. This will make it easier to manage your changes and submit pull requests.

3. **Setup up your local environment:** Follow the [Environment Setup](./env-setup) | [Functions Setup](./functions-setup) instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

4. **Make your changes:** Implement the feature or fix the bug you're working on, making sure to adhere to the [Code Standards and Conventions](../03-Guidelines/code-standards.md).

5. **Write tests:** If your changes involve new functionality, please write appropriate unit tests to ensure the code works as expected and is maintainable.

6. **Run tests and linters:** Run the test suite and linters to ensure that your changes don't introduce new issues or break existing functionality.

7. **Commit your changes:** Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message, following the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

8. **Push your changes:** Push your changes to the main repository.

9. **Create a pull request:** Submit a pull request to the main repository, detailing your changes and providing any necessary context for reviewers.

10. **Update the documentation:** If your changes involve new features, modifications to existing features, or fixing bugs that affect how users interact with the project, please update the relevant documentation to reflect those changes. Ensure that all instructions, examples, and explanations are clear, concise, and up-to-date with your latest changes.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a suggestion for a new feature, please create an issue in the main repository's issue tracker. Be sure to provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant error messages.

## Code Review Process

Once you've submitted a pull request, maintainers and other developers will review your changes. They may request changes or provide feedback to improve the quality of your code. Please be open to their suggestions and address their comments in a timely manner.
