## Question 1

### I.

**1)** *What is the main function of DNA?* **(2 marks)**

   DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) is responsible for storing and transferring genetic information. It serves as a blueprint for protein synthesis and replication of cells.

**2)** *What is the main function of RNA?* **(2 marks)**

   RNA (Ribonucleic acid) plays a crucial role in protein synthesis. It transcribes information from DNA and helps in its translation to form proteins.

**3)** *List three structural differences between DNA and RNA* **(6 marks)**

   1. DNA is double-stranded, while RNA is single-stranded.
   2. The sugar in DNA is deoxyribose, while in RNA, it is ribose.
   3. DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine, while RNA contains uracil instead.

### II.

*For meiosis, name the phase associated with each event.* **(2 marks each)**

1. Sister chromatids are separated - Anaphase II

2. Synapsis takes place - Prophase I

3. Two haploid cells are formed - Telophase II and Cytokinesis

4. Pairs of homologous chromosomes line up in the centre of the cell - Metaphase I

5. The chromosome number is officially reduced from diploid to haploid - Anaphase I


### III.

*With the aid of a labelled diagram explain in detail the process the female sex cells undergo, oogenesis.* **(20 marks)**

   Oogenesis is the process by which female gametes, or ova, are created. The process begins in the female fetus before birth with the creation of oogonia by mitotic division. These oogonia become primary oocytes and enter meiosis I, but they do not complete this stage until after puberty. During each menstrual cycle, one primary oocyte completes meiosis I to produce a secondary oocyte and a polar body. If fertilization occurs, the secondary oocyte completes meiosis II, producing an ovum and another polar body.

### IV.

*Identify the phases A-D and write a detailed description of the different cellular processes that are occurring during each phase* **(20 marks)**

**Prophase**
During prophase, the first stage of mitosis, the chromatin (DNA material) in the nucleus starts to condense and becomes visible under a microscope. The nucleolus disappears, and centrioles (organelles involved in cell division) start moving to opposite ends of the cell, forming a structure known as the spindle.

**Metaphase**
In metaphase, the chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, an imaginary line that is equidistant from the two centrosome poles. Spindle fibers from the centrioles attach to each chromatid at its kinetochore.

**Anaphase**
During anaphase, the sister chromatids (identical strands of the entire DNA molecule) of each chromosome are pulled apart and move toward the spindle poles. Once they are separated, each is considered a full chromosome.

**Telophase**
In telophase, the chromosomes reach the spindle poles, the nuclear membrane starts to reform, and the chromosomes uncoil back into chromatin. The spindle fibers also break down. This stage ends when two distinct daughter nuclei have formed.

### V.

*The purpose of DNA replication is to produce two identical copies of a DNA molecule. The process is essential for cell division. It ensures that each new cell receives its own copy of the DNA. With the aid of a labelled diagram discuss in detail the DNA replication process.* **(40 marks)**

   DNA replication is a biological process that occurs in all living organisms and copies their DNA. It is the basis for biological inheritance. The process begins with the "unzipping" of the parent molecule as the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs are broken. Each resulting single strand acts as a template for a new strand of complementary DNA. Free nucleotides are matched to the templates under the direction of DNA polymerase. The matching nucleotides are bonded into place on the new strands. Each new double-stranded DNA is identical to the original.

## Question 2

### I.

*Define each term.* **(2 marks each)**

**1)** *Sex-linkage* 

   Sex-linkage refers to the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This occurs when the gene carrying the trait is located on a sex chromosome.

**2)** *Incomplete dominance* 

   Incomplete dominance is a form of intermediate inheritance where one allele for a specific trait is not completely expressed over its paired allele, resulting in a third phenotype that is a blend of the phenotypes of the two alleles.

**3)** *Autosome* 

   Autosomes are any chromosome that is not a sex chromosome. In humans, individuals typically have 22 pairs of autosomes.

**4)** *Polygenic traits* 

   Polygenic traits are those traits that are controlled by more than one gene. Such traits may even be controlled by genes located on entirely different chromosomes.

**5)** *Phenotype* 

   Phenotype is the physical expression or characteristics of that individual. It includes physical characteristics like height, color, etc., and behavioral traits.

### II.

*Performing a genetic cross helps us to understand inheritance patterns and the behaviour of genes.*

**1)** *Describe the behaviour of the genes in the above cross.* **(2 marks)**

   This cross represents a case of incomplete dominance, where neither gene is completely dominant over the other, resulting in an intermediate phenotype, which is the orange color.

**2)** *What is the genotype of the orange flower?* **(2 marks)**

   The genotype of the orange flower is RY.

**3)** *Draw a Punnett Square and give the genotypes and phenotypes of the flowers produced from a cross between an orange and red flower.* **(4 marks)**

   Unable to draw a Punnett Square in markdown.

**4)** *What cross would produce the most orange flowered plants?* **(2 marks)**

   A cross between two orange flowered plants (RY x RY) would produce the most orange flowered plants.

## Question 3

### I.

**1)** *Define evolution.* **(5 marks)**

   Evolution is the process through which species of organisms undergo change over time through the gradual accumulation of small genetic variations. This process leads to the emergence of new species and variations within species.

**2)** *Define natural selection.* **(5 marks)**

   Natural selection is a process in evolution where organisms that are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring. It's often summed up as "survival of the fittest".

### II.

*Describe five physical trends that mark human evolution?* **(10 marks)**

1. Bipedalism: Standing up right and walking on two legs.
2. Brain size: Over time, brain size increased among human ancestors.
3. Diet: Changes in diet can be seen through physical changes in teeth and jaw structure.
4. Tool use: The creation and use of tools became more sophisticated over time.
5. Social behavior: There is evidence of increasingly complex social structures, including care for the elderly and sick.

### III.

*Describe in detail how changes within a population may come about under the following headings.*

**1)** *Mutation* **(6 marks)**

   - Mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. When a cell divides, it makes a copy of its DNA — and sometimes the copy is not quite perfect. That small difference from the original DNA sequence is a mutation.

**2)** *Natural selection* **(8 marks)**

   - Natural selection is a process where organisms that are better suited to their environment tend to survive and reproduce more offspring. The traits that help an organism survive are passed on to the next generation. Over time, these advantageous traits become more common in the population.

**3)** *Genetic drift* **(6 marks)**

   - Genetic drift is a mechanism of evolution in which allele frequencies of a population change over generations due to chance (sampling error). Genetic drift occurs in all populations of non-infinite size, but its effects are strongest in small populations.

### IV.

**1)** *Define speciation.* **(4 marks)**

   - Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species. 

**2)** *Within macroevolution there are two main forms of speciation, allopatric and sympatric. Describe in detail what both of these terms mean, giving examples in each case.* **(8 marks)**

   - Allopatric speciation occurs when a species separates into two separate groups which are isolated from one another. A physical barrier, like a mountain range or a water body, separates the species and they evolve separately. An example is the Grand Canyon squirrel.

   - Sympatric speciation occurs when new species evolve from a single ancestral species while inhabiting the same geographic region. In sympatric speciation, there's no physical barrier to interbreeding; instead, new species might be created by shifts in the ecological niche or mate choice. An example is the Hawthorn fly.

**3)** *What is the main difference between these models and how do they occur?* **(8 marks)**

   - Gradual speciation suggests that species evolve slowly and steadily over time, while punctuated equilibrium suggests that species remain stable for a long time and then undergo periods of rapid change. Gradual speciation might be seen in steadily changing environments, while punctuated equilibrium might occur when a sudden environmental change creates strong selection pressure.

### V.

*Describe in detail how Wilson’s molecular clock works.* **(40 marks)**

   The molecular clock is a technique in genetics, which researchers use to estimate the time of occurrence of events in evolutionary history. Based on the rates of molecular change, the molecular clock allows the time of divergence of two related species to be estimated. This is based on the premise that these molecular changes occur at a constant rate over time. This 'clock' ticks at a rate corresponding to the rate at which mutations accumulate in certain genes or regions of the genome. Allan Wilson and his colleagues proposed the concept of the molecular clock in the late 1960s. By comparing the amount of genetic divergence between species, mostly using mitochondrial DNA or ribosomal RNA sequences, they could estimate the time of divergence based on the rate of mutation. The molecular clock has been used to suggest that the divergence between humans and our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees, occurred between 4-8 million years ago.

## QUESTION 4

### I.
**1)** *Define a Biome.* **(3 marks)**

   A biome is a large community of plants and animals that occupies a distinct region defined by its climate and dominant vegetation, such as grassland, forest, or desert.

**2)** *Name a biome that is hot and wet.* **(3 marks)**

   The Tropical Rainforest is a biome that is characterized by being hot and wet.

**3)** *Give one specific example of flora and fauna that would occupy the biome you named in part (2).* **(4 marks)**

   An example of flora in a Tropical Rainforest could be the Kapok Tree, and an example of fauna could be the Howler Monkey.

### II.
*Define the following ecological terms.* **(2 marks each)**

**1)** *Primary producers,*

   Primary producers are organisms in an ecosystem that produce biomass from inorganic compounds. In most cases, these are photosynthetically active organisms (like plants and algae).

**2)** *Consumers,*

   Consumers are organisms that cannot manufacture their own food and need to consume other organisms.

**3)** *Ecological pyramid,*

   An ecological pyramid is a graphical representation showing the number, biomass, or energy of organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem.

**4)** *Carnivores,*

   Carnivores are organisms that mainly eat meat, or other animals.

**5)** *Decomposer*

   Decomposers are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so carry out the natural process of decomposition.

### III.
*The structure of ecosystems can be visualised with ecological pyramids. One such pyramid is the pyramid of numbers. With the aid of a diagram describe in detail what this pyramid shows.* **(20 marks)**

   An ecological pyramid of numbers shows the relative number of individual organisms at each trophic level in an ecosystem. At the base of the pyramid are the producers, who are the most numerous. The next level up, the primary consumers (herbivores), are less numerous, and so on up the pyramid with secondary consumers (carnivores) and tertiary consumers. The shape of the pyramid indicates the decrease in numbers, biomass, or energy from one trophic level to the next.

### IV.
*Ecology describes the biogeochemical cycle as a natural pathway on our planet. Describe this cycle and name three different sub cycles that occur within it.* **(20 marks)**

   A biogeochemical cycle is the pathway by which a chemical substance moves through both biotic (biosphere) and abiotic (lithosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere) compartments of Earth. These cycles involve biological, geological and chemical interactions in order to cycle nutrients through the ecosystem. Three examples of these cycles include the water cycle (hydrologic cycle), the carbon cycle, and the nitrogen cycle.

### V.
*With the aid of a labelled diagram describe the water cycle.* **(40 marks)**

   The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes how water evaporates from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses into clouds, and falls back to the surface as precipitation. The water that falls to the Earth as precipitation either evaporates, is taken up by plants, or enters rivers and eventually the ocean, where the cycle begins anew. Key stages include evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and runoff.
