## Troubleshooting and Debugging

This section provides guidance on common issues you may encounter while working on the project, along with potential solutions and tips for debugging and resolving problems.

### Common Issues and Potential Solutions

#### 1. Build errors

If you encounter build errors during the development process, consider the following:

- Check if you have installed all the required dependencies using `npm ci` or `npm install`.
- Ensure that your Node.js version matches the version specified in the `.nvmrc` or `package.json` files.
- Verify that the configuration files, such as `next.config.js`, have the correct settings.

#### 2. Failing tests

If your tests are failing:

- Review the error messages and stack traces provided by the test runner to identify the cause of the issue.
- Check if any recent changes to the codebase could have introduced the problem.
- Verify that the test data and expected results are up-to-date and accurate.

#### 3. Deployment issues

If you encounter issues during the deployment process:

- Check the logs in your CI/CD pipeline for any error messages or warnings.
- If you have made changes to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, verify that you haven't made any mistakes.

### Debugging Tips

- Use the browser's developer tools, such as the console and network tabs, to inspect runtime errors and network requests.
- Use breakpoints and the debugger in your browser's developer tools to step through the code and inspect the values of variables and expressions.
- Add `console.log` statements or use the `debugger` keyword to pause the execution of your code and inspect the values of variables and expressions at specific points in your code.
- Enable the React Developer Tools browser extension to inspect the React component tree, state, and props.

### Resolving Problems

- When you identify a problem, create a new branch to work on the fix.
- Write tests to reproduce the issue and ensure that your fix is effective.
- Review your code changes, commit them, and submit a pull request to merge the fix into the main branch.
- Ensure that your changes pass the CI/CD pipeline checks before merging the pull request.

By following the guidance provided in this section, you can effectively troubleshoot, debug, and resolve issues in your project.
